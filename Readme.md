## Automatic Irrigation and Plant Watering System Simulation with Proteus

Welcome to this simulation tutorial, where I will show you how to create an automatic irrigation and plant watering system using Arduino and a soil moisture sensor in Proteus. With this simulation, we can control water supply automatically through the system, just as if it were a real-world setup.

### What is this project for?

This simulation is ideal for small gardens, flower gardens, or greenhouses, and it's designed for educational and testing purposes. The core component of this simulation is the soil moisture sensor, which we'll use to monitor the soil's moisture level. Additionally, we'll include an LCD display to visualize the data, and you can also connect a motor pump or a buzzer to the relay in the simulation.

### How it works

In this simulation, we replicate the functionality of a real automatic irrigation system. When the soil's moisture level drops below a certain threshold, the system activates the motor or buzzer. As the soil becomes wetter, the system automatically deactivates these components. The LCD display will provide real-time information about the soil's moisture level.

### Getting Started

To get started with this simulation:

1. Open the project in Proteus.
2. Configure the virtual Arduino and soil moisture sensor.
3. Set the desired moisture level threshold and other parameters.
4. Run the simulation.

### Components

- **Arduino Board:** Simulated Arduino for control and monitoring.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Simulated sensor to measure soil moisture.
- **LCD Display:** Virtual display for visualizing soil moisture levels.
- **Relay:** To control motor pumps or buzzers based on soil moisture.

### Simulation Results

The simulation will demonstrate how the system reacts to changing soil moisture levels, activating and deactivating the connected components as needed.

Enjoy your simulation experience, and feel free to experiment with different settings and configurations!
